# Pig-Game

Pig game is a simple dice game. 
Two standard dice are rolled. If neither shows a 1, their sum is added to the turn total.
If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.
The player can roll the dice until atleast one dice shows 1 or the player clicks on hold. 
The first player to reach the winning point wins.
